Excited to share that I've successfully completed my 𝐖𝐞𝐛 𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩 with Code Clause💻

Project1: Live Language Translator

My first project was a simple but powerful Live Language Translator. It translates text entered in a text area into the selected language and displays the translated text. The Google Translate API is used for translation.

Project2: Basic Text Editor

Next, I built a basic text editor. It was a satisfying exercise in making something practical and user-friendly.

Project3: Expense Tracker

Moving on, I worked on making a basic expense tracker. It takes a title and amount as input, adds it to a list, and updates the total expenditure. 

Project4: Music Streaming page

Lastly, I created a simple and basic music streaming page. This involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design the layout, add animations, and implement basic interactivity.
